# Creating Seaborn-Like Library

This project aims to create a custom Python library inspired by Seaborn for data visualization. It focuses on building easy-to-use plotting functions and tools to make data visualization more accessible and customizable.

## Features

- Custom plotting functions that resemble Seaborn-style visualizations.
- Easy integration with pandas DataFrames.
- Flexible and configurable visualization options.
- Built-in support for common plot types (e.g., scatter plots, line plots, bar plots).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
